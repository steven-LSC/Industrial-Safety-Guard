# Industrial-Safety-Guard

This is a system for checking workersâ€™ safety equipment and counting hours. It consists of a Line chatbot and a QR code scanner.

* Line Chatbot: We use Line to build user interface, including: uploading selfies, safety equipment checking, QR code generating, encrypt time information.

* QR Code Scanner: Scan QR code to enter the construction site, get working hours.

Backend:
* Amazon Rekognition: Upload workers' selfie to Amazon Rekognition PPE to detect whether they are wearing masks and helmets.
* AWS S3: Upload worker selfies to AWS S3 for backup.
* Imgur API: Upload the QR Code to Imgur so that users can access it through the Line Chatbot.
